* What Are Dotfiles?
Dotfiles are plain-text configuration files (prefixed with a dot, like =.bashrc= or =.vimrc=) used to personalize and control the behavior of your operating system, command-line shell, and applications on Linux and other Unix-based systems (like macOS).

* Who Am I?
By day, I shape the future as a *High School Teacher*, imparting knowledge and curiosity to the next generation.
By night, I am a passionate *Cybersecurity Enthusiast* and aspiring ethical hacker. I am deeply fascinated by the world of infosec, from penetration testing and vulnerability research to digital forensics and the ever-evolving threat landscape.
This repository is a reflection of that journeyâ€”a collection of the tools, configurations, and scripts that power my exploration into the digital depths.

This repository serves a triple function
